Defining traceables
==============================================================================

Traceables are defined using the ``traceable`` directive described below.

.. rst:directive:: .. traceable:: TAG

   Create a traceable item. The ``TAG`` should be a unique string throughout
   the documentation, because it is used to reference the traceable.

   The traceable can be given attributes, such as a title, a version, and
   relationships with other traceables. Attributes are specified using the
   form ``:<option-name>: <option-value>`` [#rest-directive-spec]_.
   For example, the text below defines a traceable with tag ``LOREM-IPSUM``,
   title "Lorem ipsum", and content "Lorem ipsum dolor sit...":

   .. code-block:: rest

      .. traceable:: LOREM-IPSUM
         :title: Lorem ipsum

         Lorem ipsum dolor sit...

   Traceable directives have the following properties:

   - A single argument defining the traceable's tag (``.. traceable:: <TAG>``)

     - The tag must be unique throughout the documentation
     - The tag may not contain spaces

   - Zero or more options (``:<option-name>: <option-value>``)

     - The special option ``title`` defines the traceable's title
     - Options with a valid relationship name define relationships which
       this traceable has with other traceable
     - Arbitrary option names and values are allowed; if not special options
       as listed above, the values are stored as traceable attributes and can
       be used for filtering/querying traceables

   - Optional content

     - If content is given, it will be parsed as regular ReST.


Referencing traceables
==============================================================================

Traceables can be referenced using the ``traceable`` role described below.

.. rst:role:: traceable

   Create a reference to a traceable defined elsewhere in the
   documentation. For example:

   .. code-block:: rest

      Lorem ipsum :traceable:`LOREM-IPSUM` dolor sit...


Showing traceables matrices
==============================================================================

Relationships between traceables can be shown using the ``traceable-matrix``
directive described below.

.. rst:directive:: .. traceable-matrix::

   Generate a traceables matrix. The matrix shows pairs of traceables which
   are related to each other by a given relationship (see the
   ``:relationship:`` option below). Various formats are available for showing
   the pairs of traceables (see the ``:format:`` option below).

   The following options are available for this directive:

   ``:relationship:`` -- name of traceables relationship *(required)*
      Specify which relationship between traceables to show in the
      generated matrix.

   ``:filter-primaries:`` -- traceable filter expression *(optional)*
      Specify a filter to limit the primary traceables included in the
      matrix.

      If this option is not given, then all traceables that have
      one or more relationships of the type specified by ``:relationship:``
      will be included.

   ``:filter-secondaries:`` -- traceable filter expression *(optional)*
      Specify a filter to limit the secondary traceables included in the
      matrix.

      If this option is not given, then all traceables that have
      one or more relationships of the reverse of the type specified by
      ``:relationship:`` will be included.

   ``:format:`` -- name of format *(optional)*
      Specify the matrix format to generate. The following
      formats are available:

      - ``:format: table`` *(default)*

        Traditional traceability table format.
        This format allows the following additional options to be set:

        ``:split-secondaries:`` -- positive integer
            The maximum number of columns to output.
            If more columns would have been necessary, multiple tables will be
            generated.

        ``:split-primaries:`` -- positive integer
            The maximum number of rows to output.
            If more rows would have been necessary, multiple tables will be
            generated.

      - ``:format: columns``

        2-column table of related traceables

      - ``:format: list``

        2-level list of related traceables

For example, the directive shown below would generate a table showing
all traceables related to each other with the ``children`` relationship:

.. code-block:: rest

   .. traceable-matrix::
      :relationship: children
      :format: table

The directive shown above creates a traceability matrix as shown below.
